# As noted above in the comment for remotepasseval I tried in vain to
# get oauth working. Menno has it working following the instructions
# for "XOAuth2 authentication":
# https://github.com/OfflineIMAP/offlineimap/blob/v7.0.9/offlineimap.conf#L812
#
# Here's what I tried to set this up, all these keys have since been
# invalidated so the below isn't a security issue:
#
#    $ https_proxy= python python/oauth2.py --generate_oauth2_token  --client_id=434197482151-a1iqf44bf1jc0054big9c7prvm126qke.apps.googleusercontent.com --client_secret=om0XglM0iG7WUzj8X3512Eso
#    To authorize token, visit this url and follow the directions:
#      https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth?client_id=434197482151-a1iqf44bf1jc0054big9c7prvm126qke.apps.googleusercontent.com&redirect_uri=urn%3Aietf%3Awg%3Aoauth%3A2.0%3Aoob&response_type=code&scope=https%3A%2F%2Fmail.google.com%2F
#    Enter verification code: 4/SmF2Rhai_CUPWif9I-cYpjh_f4vKI8_3nZ4buuTLSfI
#    Refresh Token: 1/68a5NFeXLCGT-s-Gpm7BbnrzzYFVIqvSIcUrV7I-Yc_07omOeu55g6B55hCnaXoi
#    Access Token: ya29.Ci-YAy9Ukvgoc1uOilU8wryIGPniQF3nqXa-_392FlBtDNA92X24_zXJemSKSg4vIA
#    Access Token Expiration Seconds: 3600
#
#    $ https_proxy= python python/oauth2.py --user=avar@booking.com --client_id=434197482151-a1iqf44bf1jc0054big9c7prvm126qke.apps.googleusercontent.com --client_secret=om0XglM0iG7WUzj8X3512Eso --refresh_token='1/68a5NFeXLCGT-s-Gpm7BbnrzzYFVIqvSIcUrV7I-Yc_07omOeu55g6B55hCnaXoi'
#    Access Token: ya29.Ci-YAxDiXANEW_U_JAVV9QBs-CnJ0PlhQz3rGeAY4h9HqZnZJ9oCqUFeoCP7pRQaJg
#    Access Token Expiration Seconds: 3600
#
# Then this oauth config with the details above:
#
#    oauth2_client_id = 434197482151-a1iqf44bf1jc0054big9c7prvm126qke.apps.googleusercontent.com
#    oauth2_client_secret = om0XglM0iG7WUzj8X3512Eso
#    oauth2_request_url = https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/token
#    auth2_refresh_token = 1/68a5NFeXLCGT-s-Gpm7BbnrzzYFVIqvSIcUrV7I-Yc_07omOeu55g6B55hCnaXoi
#
# So the first thing that failed was an error about invalid JSON, this
# was because I had to start offlineimap with https_proxy=, but then
# it emitted some error about the authentication failing. I didn't get
# to the bottom of that and just went with password auth.
